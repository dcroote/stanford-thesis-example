## About
The hope is that this example thesis saves you time that I and countless others before me spent on the minutiae of writing a thesis in LaTeX. It combines a slightly modified version (more on this below) of the existing [Stanford thesis style](https://www.stanford.edu/dept/sul2/etdhelpupload/0/06/Suthesis-2e.sty) ([more Stanford information here](https://library.stanford.edu/research/bibliography-management/latex-bibtex-and-overleaf)) with a template for including figures, tables, inline references, equations, symbols, a bibliography, a signature page, etc...
I used this style as the basis for my (officially completed) thesis and thus believe it adheres to Stanford's policies, but I make no guarantees.

This thesis defaults to electronic submission using `\onlinetrue` in `suthesis-2e.sty`. Correspondingly, the copyright and signature pages *ii* and *iii*, respectively, are excluded as they are [added by the Library](https://registrar.stanford.edu/students/dissertation-and-thesis-submission/electronic-dissertationthesis-faq) upon submission. The last page of this example thesis is a signature page you can print, but remember to comment out `\onlinesignature` in `main.tex` before uploading your final version. **Remember to print the signature page on acid-free paper.** Likewise for the title page.

### Structure
This template adopts a modular structure where each chapter is a separate `.tex` file that is included by `main.tex`. Figures are similarly organized by publication or project. Citing references requires a bibliography in BibTeX format, which can be generated by exporting an existing collection from a reference manager such as [Mendeley](https://blog.mendeley.com/2012/03/24/how-to-series-generate-bibtex-files-for-your-collections-for-use-in-latex-part-3-of-12/), F1000, etc...

## Usage
1. Install LaTeX on your system, use a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dxjoke/tectonic-docker), or use an online service like [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com). I used Overleaf because compilation is fast and simple.
2. Clone / download this repository, and if you are using an online service, upload the files.
3. Read `main.tex` and update it with your information. Add your bibliography, figures, and chapter text. There should be no need to further modify the Stanford style file `suthesis-2e.sty`.
4. Finish and submit thesis.

## Testing
This example thesis is compiled on Travis CI with the `dxjoke/tectonic-docker` docker image.
